This solution is designed for contact center roles that involve sales or sales-related behaviors such as recommending products or services and retaining customers. Sample tasks for these jobs include: interact with customers on the phone to sell a product/service; add new or upgraded products or services; extend promotional or retention offers; respond appropriately to customer objections; navigate to information menus to assist the customer and process information; and type information quickly and accurately. Potential job titles that use this simulation are: Telesales Representative, Telemarketer, and Contact Center Representative. The behavioral tests in this solution are intended to measure the candidate\u2019s sales focus, learning potential, and the tendency to meet goals and work hard, even when faced with obstacles. Collectively, the assessments in this solution measure a wide range of important skills, abilities, and behaviors for entry-level contact center roles involving sales or sales and service.",
